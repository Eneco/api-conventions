Eneco requires a practical set of design standards for REST services, to enable fast and painless Apigee implementation.

This document provides a set of design guidelines derived from the Apigee e-book augmented with generic service design principles from the field of solution architecture.

According to the Apigee design whitepaper:
“We (Apigee) call our point of view in API design “pragmatic REST”, because it places the success of the developer over and above any other design principle. The developer is the customer for the Web API.”

The Apigee whitepaper is pragmatically based on “Representational State Transfer (REST), Roy Thomas Fielding, 2000”. It holds NO Apigee specific information, so it cannot be used directly as a guideline for Apigee configuration. The proper optimal usage scenario’s and optimale organization for Apigee are to be defined seperately. Where possible, Eneco design choices for Apigee based services will be included.
