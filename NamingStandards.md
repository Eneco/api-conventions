## Friendly Service Interface design
   **Principle: Keep it simple and consistent**  
   **Reason:** Makes the API easier to discover, easier to understand

   **Principle: Define API’s resource based (=object oriented)**  
   **Reason:** keep number of API names low

   **Principle: use plural nouns consistently  (/dogs, not /dog)**  
   **Reason:** keeps it consistent, it’s all about collections anyway

   **Principle: use concrete names, avoid abstraction**  
   **Reason:** separates services per class,  makes your API explain itself

   **Principle: allow certain fields to be retrieved**  
   **Reason:** allow the developer to reduce bandwidth by selecting just the fields he needs.

**Examples:** 

 URL | clarification |
 ---- | ----------- | 
 /dogs                        | Get the collection |
 /dogs/1234                   | Get item by ID |
 /dogs?color=black&age=3      | Get subset from collection |
/dogs:(id, name, color)       | Retrieve a list of dogs with only their id, name and color |
/dogs?fields=id, name, color  | Retrieve a list of dogs with only their id, name and color |
**NOT:** /objects/type=dog    | Avoid abstraction |

##	Methods and Non-resource based requests
   **Principle: User HTTP verbs for maintenance actions (CRUD)**  
   **Reason:** avoid an endless list of action services

**Examples:**

   Verb | URL | Clarification |
   --- | --- | ---------- |
   POST | /dogs/1234 | Create a new object |
   GET | /dogs/1234 | Read an object |
   PUT | /dogs/1234/name=Rex&…. | If exists, Update all fields (not just 1)|
   DELETE | /dogs/1234 | Delete 1 dog |
   DELETE | /dogs | Delete all dogs |

   Any actions become method names like /Users/Login  
   Alternative: POST /Session
   
**Look at the end result of the action.**  
   A login creates a new session -> POST  
   A logout removes a session -> DELETE  
   A token refresh updates a session -> PUT  
   **NOT: /getBlackDogs** -> Avoid all these variations  

   **Principle:  only use a standalone verb in case of a non-resource related request**  
   **Reason:** sometimes there is no resource or collection behind an action. In case of a calculation or translation there may be some immutable tables that are no user mutable part of the application database (text tables, country-table, money exchange rates etc).

**Examples:**

   Verb | URL | Clarification |
   --- | --- | ---------- |
   GET | /convertAmount?from=EUR&to=USD&amount=100 | Calculate dollar amount |
   GET | /search? query=terrier+red+park+johnson | Complex Search for a specific dog owned by mr. Johnson |

   **Note:** Apigee allows developer authorisations for PUT, GET, POST, DELETE. Other Verbs like OPTIONS, HEAD, are not supported by Apigee.  
   
## Object associations

   **Principle: Use no more than 2 levels in your URL**  
   **Principle: Add complexity via parameters**  
   **Reason:** reduce complexity  
   
**Examples:**

   Verb | URL | Clarification |
   --- | --- | ---------- |
   GET | /owners/1234/dogs | Read all dogs for owner 1234 |
   GET | /owners/1234/dogs?location=park | Read all dogs for owner 1234 that are in the park |

## API Subdomains

   **Principle: use 1 internet domain or your production api’s: eneco-prod.eneco.com **  
   **Reason:** APIGEE exepcts the pattern: 
```
http://{org-name}-{env}.domain.extension/………
```

The org-name is configured in Apigee as the highest level of management (the root of the configuration). The “env” is a configurable  value for the execution environment, which is a sublevel to the Organisation.

**Note:** Almost every Rest API on the web can be called and discovered via the api.domain.extension subdomain name, which is a matter of convention. The same goes for the developer documentation that is almost always on developers.x.x . But Apigee has set a different standard.

**Examples:**

URL | Clarification |
--- | ------------- |
https://eneco-prod.eneco.com/… | Base URL for api calls to Eneco services |
https://oxxio-prod.eneco.com/… | Base URL for api calls to Oxxio services |
http://developers.eneco.com/… | Base URL for developer information |

## API Partitioning and versioning

   **Principle: Devide up your API according to client applications**  
   **Reason:** Web, App and B2B clients may require different policies, versioning and governance. Different clients may require different versions of the service API
   
   
**Examples:** 
   
   URL | Clarification |
   --- | ------------- |
   /mijneneco-app/dogs | All of these endpoints on Apigee may point to the same or different backend services |
   /toon-app/dogs | All of these endpoints on Apigee may point to the same or different backend services |
   /mijneneco-web/dogs | All of these endpoints on Apigee may point to the same or different backend services |

   **Principle: each service URL has a version indicator**  
   **Reason:** service calls must be send to the right version. A new app release may point to a new API definition, while older versions of the app are still active. 
   
The correct set of URL’s is provided at build time, or via a configuration service. 
The version number indicates the version of the API definition (signature), NOT the version of the service implementation it points to. So the code may change without impact on the API version.

**NB:** do not put the Version in a HTTP header. This makes the API very hard to use from a browser.

**Examples:**

   URL | Clarification |
   --- | ------------- |
   …./v02/mijneneco-app/ dogs | Base URL points to Version 2 of the service  |
…/v01/mijneneco-web/ dogs | Base URL still points to Version 1 of the service and will upgrade in the future |

   **Principle: never hardcode the service endpoints into an application**  
   **Reason:** endpoints change per environment, and should never be modified in the original code files. This would require a checkin and a re-test of the application.
   
The correct set of URL’s must be  provided at build time, via a config file, or via a configuration service. 

## What Content Type?

   **Principle: pass the content-type as a parameter**  
   **Reason:** Using a parameter instead of a header makes the service easier to test via a browser (if there are multiple response formats)
   
**Examples:**

   URL | Clarification |
   --- | ------------- |
   /dogs.json | Request a JSON response, if not the default |
   /dogs?format=xml | Request a XML response |

## JSON attribute naming

   **Principle: use Java or JavaScript naming conventions for JSON fields (use Camel case, start with lowercase)**  
   **Reason:** the names in the JSON show up in your code after you parsed the JSON response into a response object. The JSON field names have become your class’s field names, which you are going to use in your code.

**Examples:**

JSON field: createdAt -> Results in timestamp=myObject.createdAt;
