# API Conventions

All teams within Eneco Retail use the same API Conventions

## Why?
- Different teams should be able to work independently
- This adds to the flexibility and agility of the organisation

## What?
- Within Eneco we are going to work with clear API conventions
- We will define and share templates and examples here

## How?
- These conventions will be shared during the bigroom sessions
- The conventions and templates are accessible to all
